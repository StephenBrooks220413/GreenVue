                Fort Sill’s latest graduating class of basic trainees were the
                first in the Army to don the spiffy new duds that harken back to
                the uniforms worn by the Greatest Generation.

                If you are keeping track, that’s seven young Fort Hood soldiers
                found dead under suspicious circumstances in just under five
                months. While it does not appear that all are related, it’s hard
                to ignore the coincidence of four soldiers shot to death in
                seemingly random crimes. The sheer number of dead soldiers in
                such a short time is disturbing.

                BACK-AND-FORTH announcements from two major companies – Pfizer
                and Moderna – about the high efficacy of their coronavirus
                vaccines has peaked hope in a possible light at the end of the
                tunnel as the U.S. experiences more infections than ever before,
                but questions remain about timing, distribution and storage. The
                companies announced this week that their vaccines are both over
                94% effective in preventing the virus, and both are expected to
                soon file for emergency use authorization with the Food and Drug
                Administration.
